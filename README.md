# ReversiAlpha
A GitHub for a school-project.  Implements Reversi with some abstract methods and such.  Really overkill.  

# Usage
You must pass 2 arguments to the program.  The 1st argument determines the behaviour of the Dark player, and the 2nd determines the behaviour of the Light player.  Dark always goes first.  These arguments must be any of the following:  
* <code>HumanPlayer</code>:  This player is a human player.  
* <code>RandomComputerPlayer</code>:  This player is a CPU-player, and is to move randomly.  
* <code>IntelligentComputerPlayer</code>:  This player is a CPU-player, and is to move pseudo-intelligently.
