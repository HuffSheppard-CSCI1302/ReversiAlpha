# Compilation
Simply run <code>compile.sh</code>.  Couldn't be easier.  

# Details
This script will compile all the .java files in ./src, place them into a new dir ./build, and then add them to a .jar which will be placed in the project's root.  Optionally, the script can delete ./build after running, but you'll have to uncomment the line which does so if you desire this behaviour.
