# ReversiAlpha
A GitHub for a school-project.  Implements Reversi with some abstract methods and such.  Really overkill.  

# Compilation
Simply run <code>compile.sh</code>.  Couldn't be easier.  

# Usage
You must pass 2 arguments to the program.  These must be any of the following:  
* HumanPlayer
* RandomComputerPlayer
* IntelligentComputerPlayer
The first argument determines the behaviour of the Dark player, and the second determines the behaviour of the Light player.  Dark always goes first.
